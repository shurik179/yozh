Motors
=======

Get the N20 motors. Strip four 5-cm pieces of solid core 22AWG wire. Use pliers
to form a short (about 3mm) 90 degree bend at **one** end of each of these pieces
of wire.

Now, solder these wires to motor terminals  as shown in the photo below.

**Important**: pay attention to proper orientation of the motors! One of motor
terminals is marked +; make sure that this terminal is on the right side as
shown in the photos.
