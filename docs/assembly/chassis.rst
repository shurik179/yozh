Assembling the chassis
======================
Take the Zumo chassis kit and open it. Make sure you have all components
as listed in `Zumo chassis user guide <https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J54/1>`__.
Discard the acrylic plate - we wont' be using it.

Now follow these steps:


1. Remove the cover  from the battery compartment of the chassis. Turn the
   chassis upside down and insert 4 M2.5 screws from Yozh kit in the
   holes as shown in the photo below. It should be a tight fit -- use a screwdriver
   to drive the screws all the way in.

2. Turn the chassis right side up. Attach the idler sprockets following the
   directions of `Zumo user guide  <https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J54/3>`__.

3. Insert the motors in the channel at the front of the chassis, aligning the
   gearbox with the grooves in the channel. The front plate of the gearbox
   should be even with the edge of the chassis. The wires you had soldered previously
   should be facing up.

4. Take the spacer PCB and place it on the chassis, carefully threading the
   motor wires in the holes in PCB. The screws you had inserted should match
   the holes in the spacer PCB.
   **Warning**: spacer PCB is not symmetric - pay attention to **This side up**
   marking.

5. Repeat the same with the main board. Make sure that this board lies flat
   against the spacer board, with no gaps anywhere.

6. Tightly screw the 22mm M2.5 standoffs from the Yozh kit onto the screws
   protruding through the main board.

7. Put the front wheels on the motors, paying attention to orientation as described
   in `Zumo chassis assembly guide <https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J54/3>`__.
   Put the silicone tracks on wheels (requires a little effort).
