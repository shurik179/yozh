Itsy Bitsy and the top board
============================

Before proceeding, make sure that the main switch on Yozh robot is in OFF
position.

1. Install CircuitPython on your  Itsy Bitsy RP2040 microcontroller as described
   in `Adafruit Learn Guide <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-itsybitsy-rp2040/circuitpython>`__.

2. Solder two 14-pin male headers to the  Itsy Bitsy board. If you need help
   with that, check `this guide <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-rp2040-pico/assembly>`__ -
   it is about a different board, but the process is the same, except that Itsy
   Bitsy uses two 14-pin headers. **Do not solder headers to the short edge!**

3. Insert the Itsy Bitsy board into the female headers on the main Yozh board,
   with the USB connector facing out. Double-check that it is plugged correctly -
   it is easy to make a mistake, shifting the board by one position.

4. Insert the two 4-pin 15mm male headers into the 2*4 female header on the main
   Yozh board.

5. Take the top plate board, with the OLED display, and place it on top of the
   robot so that the male headers from the previous step are plugged into the 2*4
   female header on the bottom of the top plate. Double-check that it is plugged
   correctly by looking from the sides.

6. Use the M2.5 screws to attach the top plate to the standoffs on the Yozh robot.
