Dimensions  and 3d model
========================

Yozh dimensions are 12.4 cm (Length) * 13 cm (width) * 4.9 cm (height).
Ground clearance is about 7 mm; however, since all sensors and everything else
is inside the tracks profile (looking from the side), the robot is capable of
going over (long) obstacles up to about 1.5 cm.
