Buzzer and LEDs
===============
Yozh contains a buzzer and two addressable RGB LEDs (commonly called NeoPixels),
which can be used for showing information to the user.

Finally, Yozh contains four RGBW NeoPixels of the front panel, which are intended to
be used as headlights. Normally, one only uses the white LED part of these NeoPixels;
however, if necessary, you can also use the RGB part to create headlights  of any color.
