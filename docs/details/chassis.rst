Chassis and motors
===================
Yozh robot uses custom-made chassis, using 
`silicone tracks <https://www.pololu.com/product/3034>`__ by Pololu together with two
`75:1 High Power 6V microgear motors <https://www.pololu.com/product/2215>`__. The
motors are equipped with encoders (rotation counters), for speed control. The
motors are controlled by DRV8833 motor driver by TI.


In the front of the robot there is a metal blade protecting it from collisions.

Maximal speed of the robot is FIXME m/s.
