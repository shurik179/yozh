Serial console
==============
For debugging the program, one needs  to print some
information such as variable values and error messages. Python has built-in command
`print()` which does that. The output of print command is sent to `serial console` -
which in practice just means that it is sent over USB to the computer.

Thonny  editor has built-in serial console, so you can see these messages. 
By default, the  serial console appears at the bottom of the screen.


Among other features it provides is the ability to enter Python commands
interactively in the console, without saving them to a file - this is very
useful for testing various things. This is called REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop);
